%When we remove a triangle by slicing the SSC, 
%we may want to keep three vertices of the triangle 
%instead of making four vertices.
%In this case, the polyhedron (with five faces) should have curly edges,
%which is also known as a \emph{curved polyhedron}.
%The slopes of curly edges need to be studied.







































%Some research questions are as follows.
%What aspects should we optimize 
%(e.g., minimizing the number of merging events or 
%assigning similar numbers of merging steps to each event)?
%What algorithm should we use 
%(e.g., dynamic programming, \Astar, or integer linear programming)?
%How much time is gained for users to observe the merging steps on the screen?
%How to store the parallel merging steps?

%The appendix is an optional section that can contain details and data supplemental to the main text. For example, explanations of experimental details that would disrupt the flow of the main text, but nonetheless remain crucial to understanding and reproducing the research shown; figures of replicates for experiments of which representative data is shown in the main text can be added here if brief, or as Supplementary data. Mathematical proofs of results not central to the paper can be added as an appendix.

%\section{}
%All appendix sections must be cited in the main text. In the appendixes, Figures, Tables, etc. should be labeled starting with `A', e.g., Figure A1, Figure A2, etc.
