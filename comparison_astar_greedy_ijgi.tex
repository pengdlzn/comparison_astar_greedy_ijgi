\subsection{Type Change}

When we aggregate land-cover polygon~$p$ into land-cover polygon~$q$,
the type of~$p$ is changed to the type of~$q$.  
We define the cost of type change as
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:f_type}
f_\mathrm{type}(p,q)=a_p \cdot d_\mathrm{type}(T(p),T(q)),
\end{equation}
where $a_p$ is the area of land-cover polygon~$p$. 
Expressions~$T(p)$ and~$T(q)$ denote the types of the two polygons, respectively.
Formula~$d_\mathrm{type}(T(p),T(q))$ is the distance of the two types;
\fig\ref{fig:evaluations_type_distance} shows an example of type distances.

\begin{figure*}[tb]
\centering
\includegraphics[page=1]{evaluations}
\caption{An example of type distances of land-cover polygons, 
    where each color represents a type.
}
\label{fig:evaluations_type_distance}
\end{figure*}


We have two preferences for the type change when we generate intermediate maps.
First, the changes of each step should be small.
Take \fig\ref{fig:evaluations} for example, the corresponding polygons of
set~$C_{2,1}$ (the relevant places after  changing) and 
set~$C_{1,2}$ (the relevant places before changing)
should be similar in terms of land-cover types.
Therefore, we define the cost of type change of a step,
from state~$s-1$ to state~$s$, as
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:F_type}
F_\mathrm{type}(s)=\sum_{i=1}^{|C_{s-1,s}|} f_\mathrm{type}(p_i,q_i),
\end{equation}
where corresponding polygons~$p_i$ and~$q_i$ are respectively from 
the two sets of changed polygons~$C_{s-1,s}$ and~$C_{s,s-1}$.
There holds~$|C_{s-1,s}| = |C_{s,s-1}|$.
According to the type distances defined in \fig\ref{fig:evaluations_type_distance},
we have~$F_\mathrm{type}(2)=120$
for type changes from set~$C_{1,2}$ to set~$C_{2,1}$ 
(see \fig\ref{fig:evaluations}), and
we have~$F_\mathrm{type}(3)=82$
for type changes, from set~$C_{2,3}$ to set~$C_{3,2}$.


Our second preference for the type change is that 
the differences between an intermediate map and the start map
should be small.
Take \fig\ref{fig:evaluations} for example, the corresponding polygons of
set~$C'_{3,1}$ (the relevant places after  changing) and 
set~$C'_{1,3}$ (the relevant places before changing)
should be similar in terms of land-cover types.
We define this cost, from state~$1$ to state~$s$, as
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:F_type_prime}
F'_\mathrm{type}(s)=\sum_{i=1}^{|C'_{1,s}|} f_\mathrm{type}(p'_i,q'_i),
\end{equation}
where corresponding polygons~$p'_i$ and~$q'_i$ are respectively from 
the two sets of changed polygons~$C'_{1,s}$ and~$C'_{s,1}$.
There holds~$|C'_{1,s}| = |C'_{s,1}|$.
According to the type distances defined in \fig\ref{fig:evaluations_type_distance},
we have~$F'_\mathrm{type}(3)=172$
for type changes, from set~$C'_{1,3}$ to set~$C'_{3,1}$
(see \fig\ref{fig:evaluations}).

\subsection{Length Change}

{\color{red}the length should not decrease evenly. 
Instead, it should decrease evenly on map.}

We also have two preferences for the shape when we generate intermediate maps.
First, the interior length should decrease evenly from the current map.
Take \fig\ref{fig:evaluations} for example, 
from state~$s=3$ the interior length should decrease by~$12$ at each step.
Therefore, we define the cost of length change of a step,
from state~$s-1$ to state~$s$, as
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:F_lgth}
F_\mathrm{lgth}(s)=
    \left(\ell_\mathrm{int}(s-1)-\ell_\mathrm{int}(s)-
        \frac{\ell_\mathrm{int}(s-1)}{n_\mathrm{state}-s+1}\right)^2,
\end{equation}
where expression~$\ell_\mathrm{int}(s-1)-\ell_\mathrm{int}(s)$ 
is the decrease of interior length from state~$s-1$ to state~$s$.
Parameter~$n_\mathrm{state}$ denotes the total number of states.
Expression~$\frac{\ell_\mathrm{int}(s-1)}{n_\mathrm{state}-s+1}$
is the average decrease of interior length from state~$s-1$ 
to a map with all the polygons merged.
Take \fig\ref{fig:evaluations} for example,
we have~$n_\mathrm{state}=5$ and~$F_\mathrm{lgth}(3)=\frac{16}{9}$.


Our second preference of for the shape is that
the interior length should decrease evenly from the start map. 
Take \fig\ref{fig:evaluations} for example, 
from time~$state=1$ the interior length should decrease by~$11$ at each step.
We define this cost as
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:F_lgth_prime}
F'_\mathrm{lgth}(s)=
\left(\ell_\mathrm{int}(s-1)-\ell_\mathrm{int}(s)-
        \frac{\ell_\mathrm{int}(1)}{n_\mathrm{state}-1}\right)^2,
\end{equation}
where expression~$\frac{\ell_\mathrm{int}(1)}{n_\mathrm{step}-1}$
is the average decrease of interior length from state~$s=1$ 
to a map with all the polygons merged.
Take \fig\ref{fig:evaluations} for example,
we have~$F'_\mathrm{lgth}(3)=1$.

We define the total cost of the whole aggregation sequence
based on \eqs\ref{eq:F_type}, \ref{eq:F_type_prime}, 
\ref{eq:F_lgth}, and \ref{eq:F_lgth_prime}. 
That is,
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:F}
F = \sum_{s=2}^{n_\mathrm{state}}
        \bigg(
            (2-\lambda)F_\mathrm{type}(s) +
            (2-\lambda)F'_\mathrm{type}(s) + 
            \lambda F_\mathrm{lgth}(s) +
            \lambda F'_\mathrm{lgth}(s)
        \bigg),
%F = \sum_{s=2}^{n_\mathrm{state}}
%        \left( 
%            (2-\lambda)F_\mathrm{type}(s) +
%            (2-\lambda)F'_\mathrm{type}(s) + 
%            \frac{\lambda d_\mathrm{type\_max}}{2} F_\mathrm{lgth}(s) +
%            \frac{\lambda d_\mathrm{type\_max}}{2}F'_\mathrm{lgth}(s)
%        \right),
\end{equation}
where parameter~$\lambda$ $(0\le \lambda \le 2)$ can be used to assign the importances of 
type change and length change.
In our experiment, we set $\lambda=1$.
%Constant~$d_\mathrm{type\_max}$ is the maximum distance between two land-cover types,
%which is known from input.
%For example,
%we have~$d_\mathrm{type\_max}=4$ for the instance of \fig\ref{fig:evaluations_type_distance}.
%We use expression~$\frac{d_\mathrm{type\_max}}{2}$ to, hopefully, 
%make the cost of type change and the cost of length change comparable.

We use the interior length instead of the compactness to define the cost of shape
because we think the interior length is more versatile.
By contrast, some land-cover polygons like shapes with high compactnesses 
(e.g., forests and lakes),
while some other land-cover polygons like shapes with low compactnesses 
(e.g., roads and rivers).

\section{Conclusion}
We considered only two operations: split and merge.
One may need to extend our method according to their demands.


%When we remove a triangle by slicing the SSC, 
%we may want to keep three vertices of the triangle 
%instead of making four vertices.
%In this case, the polyhedron (with five faces) should have curly edges,
%which is also known as a \emph{curved polyhedron}.
%The slopes of curly edges need to be studied.







































%Some research questions are as follows.
%What aspects should we optimize 
%(e.g., minimizing the number of merging events or 
%assigning similar numbers of merging steps to each event)?
%What algorithm should we use 
%(e.g., dynamic programming, \Astar, or integer linear programming)?
%How much time is gained for users to observe the merging steps on the screen?
%How to store the parallel merging steps?
